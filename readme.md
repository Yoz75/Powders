Powders is a simple [TPT](https://github.com/The-Powder-Toy/The-Powder-Toy)-like game, but trying to be more physically correct (or not, haha)! The key feature -- you can add your own types without any coding! 
This game uses Entity-Component-System, you have to modify game's code to add new components, but you can just add a directory and some .json files to build your own particle type from already 
existing components!

## Controls
* WASD or mouse -- move camera
* Mouse wheel -- zoom in\out
* LMB -- spawn a particle
* RMB -- remove a particle
* Currently you can change current spawn type by buttons on screen.
* 1 -- select basic render mode
* 2 -- select temperature render mode

## Building
* build.bat -- debug build (very laggy!)
* buildr.bat -- regular release buildr
* buildrsw.bat -- build game without annoying console (only Windows!)
* run.bat -- helper bat file to run game from console
